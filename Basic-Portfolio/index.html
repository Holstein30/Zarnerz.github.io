			<p>My name is Dale Holstein and I am a 26 year old aspiring developer. I am a graduate of Marshall University with a bachelor's of History. I have always been fascinated with technology but I did not have any exposure to coding or development until the end of college. I have dabbled around with coding through online resources such as freecodecamp.com, codecademy.com, and udemy.com and really enjoyed the process of learning something new and challenging. I then enrolled in an introduction to programming and logic class where I was exposed to Python. This class inspired me to go all in on a career change to become a developer.</p>

			<p>I began by looking into getting a second degree in Computer Science and started to research different programs and trying to estimate how long this process would take and how much it would cost. That is when I stumbled across the coding bootcamp at UNCC. After researching the program I decided that this was exactly what I was looking for to jumpstart my new career path. I am now diving headlong into this process and look forward to what the future holds.</p>
